In this project, I am shown a design that I am assigned to replicate from scratch using what I have learned about flexbox.

While it is unlikely that I will get the design pixel-perfect, I am going to approach this project by substituting content and personalizing it. In this case, I will recreate the original layout provided to me. I will then make another webpage to resemble a page that one would see when visiting a travel site for Tokyo, Japan. With the Toyko page, I will personalize it so that the content relates to Tokyo and Japan. I will make it so that the link will be in the layout recreation. That way, people can click on it and see the Tokyo personalization.
